# Ghent University Programming Course 2024-2025

## Overview
Welcome to my repository for the Python programming course offered by Ghent University for the academic year 2024-2025. This repository contains my solutions to the exercises assigned throughout the semester as part of the programming module hosted on Dodona.be. The exercises are designed to provide practice and reinforce programming concepts, with automated feedback to guide learning.

## Course Structure
The course is structured into ten series, each focusing on different programming techniques. The weekly learning path includes:
- **Assigned reading from the course book** to prepare for lectures.
- **Additional assignments** to build foundational understanding before attempting the exercises.
- **Tips & Tricks** to enhance problem-solving strategies.
- **Mandatory exercises**, including ISBN validation problems, which must be submitted before the deadline every Tuesday at 22:00.

## Repository Content
This repository includes:
- **Python solutions** to the assigned exercises, with each solution adhering to the requirements set by the course.
- **Solutions to ISBN exercises**, which are part of the mandatory tasks.
- **Documented code** to facilitate understanding and maintain readability.

Sample solutions for certain exercises, like ISBN validation, can be found on Ufora. I have also added relevant comments within my code for clarity.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone or download the repository to explore my solutions.
- Refer to the comments and documentation for better insight into each approach.
- Compare solutions and experiment with modifications for a deeper understanding.

## Note
Solutions pushed to this repository are based on my personal learning experience. The course structure emphasizes academic integrity, and students are encouraged to solve exercises independently. This repository serves as a reference for learning purposes and not as a direct submission aid.
